<p>Or more correctly, <em>not enough</em> working on FastAPI Restly.
Which is a REST framework, like the venerable DRF, but different.
The nice people at ClearBlue Markets allowed me to open source this part of the work that I did there.</p>
<p>It is such a pain to write CRUD in FastAPI. There are CRUD libraries out there, but when I was checking (almost two years ago now) I didn't like any of them.
So I wrote my own. It is not actually the first time I did this.
During my time at EclecticIQ, I wrote something similar for Flask, but flask-classy was doing part of the heavy lifting and writing a CRUD class from there was not so hard.
Still, you want steady patterns when tieing it together with SQLAlchemy and I got to nice declarative point which made me really happy.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import fastapi_restly as fr

class ArticleView(fr.AsyncAlchemyView):
    prefix = &quot;/articles&quot;
    model = Article

</code></pre>
<p>This code gives CRUD. It creates several pydantic schemas under the hood, as well as a FastAPI router and several FastAPI endpoints. All of which can be overridden and customized.</p>
<p>I'm very happy with what I've got so far. But there is still plenty to do before I can publish it to PyPI. Primarily it needs a great deal of documentation. But I'd also like to add more tests; I really want it to be rock-solid and there are some features there that I don't fully trust yet.</p>
<p>This thing is actually in production at two companies where I worked. So it works, and it works well. But I've been the one applying it, and I'm sure other developers will use it in ways I didn't think of.</p>
